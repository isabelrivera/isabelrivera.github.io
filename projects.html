		<h3>BabyVice</h3>
		<img src="babylogo.png" id="babylogo" class="img-fluid">
		<p>Our team is aiming to create a 'one stop hub', in the form of an application, for all
		things baby. This app will be design to provide expecting parents, parents who want to plan, and first time parents
	with the proper advice, information and resources needed to care for a beautiful baby.</p>

	<h5> Story boarding</h5>
	<img src="storyboard.png" id="storyboard" class="img-fluid">
	<p1>We aim to be as inclusive and thoughtful as possible when creating this app. We want to not only cater to new mothers
	but also fathers, heterosexual couples, single parents, and all those who may need a little bit of help raising their child.</p1>
	

	 <h5> Protyping</h5>
	 <img src="cogs.png" id="cogs" class="img-fluid">
	  <p2>Our team has developed a couple of main categories that the app will contain. 
	  	I was responsible for
		 creating a protype of the initial sign up screen. Once opening the app, the user will be prompted to
		 sign up either using partnering social media apps, using their own phone number or email. From here, the user
		 will be asked questions to better create recommendations for the user. The first question asks how old the
		 users baby is or whether they are expecting or planning to have a baby. More questions arise from here to
		 finally direct the user to their profile page.</p2>

		<h3>DSGN 1</h3>
		<p> In Design of Everyday things, a class provided by UCSD, I began to learn about UX design and research. Here, we completed three user experience projects. Our final project consisted of creating a whole lo-fi prototype of a common day object. My group and I decided to redesign microwave keypads.</p>
	    

		<img src="dsgn2.png" id="dsgn" class="img-fluid">
		<p1> We conducted a whole user experience research project and each member created a prototype of the new microwave keypad. We then compared each keypad to decide on which characteristics would be perfect for the final redesign.
